Harsanyi, Member, IEEE, and Chein-I \nChang, Senior Member, IEEE Abstruct-Most applications of hyperspectral \nimagery re- quire processing techniques which achieve two fundamental \ngoals: 1) detect and \nclassify the constituent materials \nfor each pixel in \nthe scene; 2) reduce the data \nvolumeldimensionality, without loss of critical information, \nso that it can \nbe processed efficiently and assimilated \nby a human analyst. In this \npaper, we describe a technique which simultaneously \nreduces the data \ndimensionality, suppresses undesired \nor inter- fering spectral \nsignatures, and detects the presence of \na spec- tral signature of \ninterest. The basic concept \nis to project each \npixel vector onto \na subspace which \nis orthogonal to the unde- sired signatures. This \noperation is \nan optimal interference \nsuppression process in \nthe least squares sense. \nOnce the \ninter- fering signatures have been \nnulled, projecting the residual onto \nthe signature of interest maximizes the \nsignal-to-noise ratio \nand results in \na single \ncomponent image that represents \na classifi- \ncation for the signature of interest. The orthogonal subspace \nprojection (OSP) operator can \nbe extended to k signatures of \ninterest, thus reducing the dimensionality \nof k and classifying the hyperspectral image simultaneously. The approach is ap- plicable to both spectrally pure \nas well as \nmixed pixels. I. INTRODUCTION YPERSPECTRAL imaging \nspectrometer data \npro- H vide a wealth of information which can be used to address a variety of earth remote sensing problems. \nA short list of applications includes \nenvironmental mapping, \nglobal change \nresearch, geological research, wetlands mapping, assessment \nof trafficability , plant and mineral identification and abundance estimation, crop analysis, \nand bathymetry. The common theme \nin all of these \nap- plications is the \nrequirement for classification of each pixel in the scene, \nand reduction \nof data volume \nto tract- \nable levels. \nClassification of a hyperspectral \nimage sequence amounts to identifying which pixels contain various spec- \ntrally distinct materials that have been specified \nby the user. Several techniques \nfor classification of multilhyper- spectral pixels have been used from \nminimum distance and maximum \nlikelihood classifiers \n[ 13 to correlation/ \nmatched filter-based approaches such \nas spectral signature \nmatching [2] and the spectral angle \nmapper [3].

To reduce the data volume, \ntechniques for reducing the image dimensionality \nare often applied. Typically, the di- \nmensionality of a hyperspectral image cube \nis reduced \nby applying a linear transformation, \nsuch as a \nprincipal com- \nponents transformation, and retaining only \nthe significant components for further processing. The \nprincipal com- \nponents transformation produces \na new set of uncorre- lated images that \nare ordered in terms of decreasing in- formation or, equivalently, decreasing \nvariance [4]. Although each hyperspectral pixel \nis a \nhigh (> 100) di- mensional vector, most of the information about \nthe scene \ncan be described by a few (generally less than ten) \ndi- mensions. This reduced dimensionality \nis known as the \nintrinsic dimensionality \n[SI. A recent improvement \nto the principal components \ntransformation is the \nnoise-adjusted principal components \ntransformation [6]. This transfor- mation orders the \nnew images in terms of \nsignal-to-noise ratio, and thus deemphasizes \nnoise in the resulting images \nAlthough these approaches \nare sufficient for reducing data volume, they do not emphasize individual spectral classes or signatures of interest. For example, the \nfirst principal component image \ncontains the \nmost infonna- tiodvariance, but it is generally \na linear \ncombination of information from \nseveral spectral classes. This is a direct \nconsequence of the fact \nthat most materials resident \nin hyperspectral scenes have spectral signatures \nthat are cor- related, whereas the eigenvectors \nused to derive the \nprin- cipal component images \nare, of course, orthogonal. \nIn this paper, we describe a technique \nwhich simulta- neously reduces data dimensionality to a \nuser-prescribed level and produces a new sequence of images which high- light the presence of each signature of interest. These \nnew component images represent \nclass maps for each of the signatures of interest. The technique is \nbased on \nthe con- \ncept of orthogonal subspace projection which is a \nresult from the theory \nof least squares \nand has been \nfurther de- veloped in \nthe sensor \narray processing \ncommunity [8], [9]. 171. i 0196-2892/94$04.00 0 1994 IEEE 'b"780 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 32, NO. 4, JULY 1994 An equivalent result \ndirected at image \nsequence process- ing has also been developed using \nthe concept of simul- taneous diagonalization \n(SD) filtering [ 101. The technique presented here \nrecasts the results \nfrom [8]-[lo] into an intuitive two-step \ndevelopment. First, \nwe determine the matrix operator which eliminates undesired or interfering signatures and is an optimal interference \nrejection process \nin the least squares sense. Second, \nwe develop a vector \noperator which maximizes the residual desired \nsignature signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A \ncombination of these op- erators into an overall OSP classification \noperator reduces the non-Gaussian detection and classification problem \npresented by mixed pixels to the \nsolved problem \nof de- tecting an unknown constant in white noise. \nThe rest of the paper \nis organized as follows. \nSection I1 covers formulation \nof the problem. \nSection I11 intro- duces the concept of orthogonal subspace projection, \nand introduces the hyperspectral pixel classification \noperator. Results of simulations and application of the operator \nto AVIRIS data are presented in Sections IV and V, respec- tively, and concluding remarks \nare given in Section VI. 11. PROBLEM FORMULATION A hyperspectral image \ncube is made up \nof hundreds of spatially registered \nimages, taken contiguously \nover a \nlarge wavelength region, with high (< 10 nm) spectral resolution [ 111. Each pixel in a hyperspectral \nimage cube is an observation vector which represents the \nreflected en- ergy spectrum of the materials within \nthe spatial area cov- \nered by the pixel. \nExisting hyperspectral sensors produce \nobservation vectors that have \nseveral hundred elements. For example, \neach pixel from \nthe NASAIJPL Airborne \nVisible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) con- tains 224 elements corresponding to \n224 spectral wave- length bands ranging from \n0.4 to 2.5 pm. Each spectral band has approximately \na 10 nm bandwidth. Generally, the spatial coverage \nof each pixel \nmay en- compass several different materials, each with a unique spectral signature. \nIn this case, the observation vector \nis affected by the individual spectral signatures \nof each ma- terial, and the pixel is termed mixed [4], [5]. A mixed pixel containing \np spectrally distinct materials, \ndenoted by the 1 X 1 vector r(x, y), can be described by the linear model (1) where 1 is the number of spectral bands, \n(n, y) is the \nspa- tial position \nof the pixel, M = (ul - - - ui * * - up - d) is an 1 X p matrix with linearly independent columns and \nthe 1 X 1 column vector ui is the spectral signature \nof the ith distinct \nmaterial, a(x, y) is a p X 1 vector where the ith element represents the \nfraction of the ith \nsignature present in the pixel, \nand n(x, y) is an \n1 x 1 vector repre- \nsenting random noise which is assumed \nto be an inde- pendent, identically \ndistributed (i.i.d.) \nGaussian process \nwith zero mean and \ncovariance matrix a2Z. Without loss of generality, we assume that the \nlast col- \numn of M is the \ndesired signature of interest which is de- r(x, Y) = Ma(& Y) + n(x, Y) noted by d. The remaining columns \nare undesired signa- tures denoted \nby U = (uI - - ui - - \n- up-,) that are assumed to \nbe linearly independent. An equivalent state- \nment of \n(1) which separates the desired and \nundesired sig- natures is given by r = da, + Uy + It. (2) Here, we have suppressed the \nspatial position of the pixel for convenience, ap is the fraction of the desired signa- \nture, and y is a vector \nwhich contains the \nfirst p - l ele- ments of a. We now \ndevelop an operator which eliminates the ef- fects of U and maximizes the remaining signal energy \nwith respect to the \nnoise. 111. HYPERSPECTRAL PIXEL \nCLASSIFICATION A. Interference Rejection by Orthogonal Subspace \nProjection The first step in deriving a \nclassification operator for \nthe signature of interest d is to eliminate the \neffects of interfering signatures which are represented by the col- \numns of U. The approach is to \nform an \noperator that pro- \njects r onto a subspace \nthat is orthogonal to the \ncolumns of U. The vector \nresulting from such \nan operation will only contain energy \nassociated with the desired signature \nd and random \nnoise. The least squares optimal interfer- \nence rejection \noperator is \ngiven by the 1 x 1 matrix P = (I - UUU) (3) where U# = (UTU)-'UT is the \npseudoinverse of U. This operator has the same structure as the \northogonal comple- \nment projector from \nthe theory of least squares \n[9] and the signal blocking matrix \nwhich has been used \nin the sensor \narray processing community \n[SI. In the case at hand, \nhow- ever, the operator \nminimizes energy \nassociated with the signatures not of interest as opposed to minimizing \nthe total least squares error. \nOperating on (2), we have (4) Pr = Pda, + Pn. It is clear that this approach is an optimal \ninterference rejection process \nin the least squares sense since \nP re- duces the contribution of U to zero. Additional informa- \ntion regarding orthogonal \nsubspace projection operators and their properties \ncan be found in [8]-[lo], [123, and 1131. B. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Maximization The second \nstep in deriving the \npixel classification \nop- erator is to \nfind the 1 X I operator xT which maximizes \nthe SNR. Operating \non (4), we have which is a scalar. \nThe signal-to-noise-energy ratio is given \nxTPr = xTPdap + xTPn (5) by xTPda;dTPTx a; xTp&TpTx xTPE{nnT}PTx o2 xTppTx (6) -_ - A= where E{ * } denotes the expected value. "b"HARSANYI AND CHANG: HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION \n& DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION \nMaximization of this \nquotient is the generalized \neigen- vector problem \nPddTPTx = XPPTx (7) where X = X(a2/ap). The value of xT which maximizes can be determined in general using techniques \noutlined in [lo] and the idempotent (P2 = P) and symmetric \n(PT = P) properties of the interference rejection operator. The \nresult is xT = KdT (8) where K is an arbitrary \nscalar. C. Orthogonal Subspace \nProjection (OSP) \nClassijication Operator \nSubstituting the result in (8) into (3, we see that the overall classification \noperator for a \ndesired hyperspectral \nsignature in the presence of multiple undesired signatures and white noise is given \nby the 1 x I vector qT = dTP. (9) This is an intuitively pleasing result \nsince it \nfirst nulls the interfering signatures, and then uses \na matched filter for the desired signature to \nmaximize the SNR. The operator \nis similar to a \nresult from \nthe sensor \narray processing \ncommunity which \nis used for higher \nrank spectrum esti- mation or, equivalently, estimation of the SNR for a can- \ndidate multiemitter matched filter \n[9]. It is also one \nof the limiting special \ncases that is derived \nin [lo] for the si- \nmultaneous diagonalization (SD) filter with noise vari- \nance equal to \nzero. Finally, the operator \ncan be shown to provide least squares optimal fraction \nimages [ 121 that are equivalent to those produced \nby linear mixture modeling \ntechniques [4], [5], \n[14]-[18]. An interesting consequence of the two-step \ndevelop- ment approach that we have used \nto arrive \nat this result is \nto show that the \nequivalent SD filter for the \nzero noise \nvariance case is also the least squares \noptimal interference rejectiodmax SNR filter for the case \nwhen white noise is \npresent with variance u2. This is \nimportant from \nan au- tomatic detection perspective since \nthis operator reduces the non-Gaussian mixed \npixel classification \nproblem to the problem of detecting the \nunknown constant \nd TPdop in the presence of white noise. When the operator in \n(9) is applied to all \nof the pixels \nin a hyperspectral scene, each 1 x 1 pixel is reduced to \na scalar which is a measure of the presence of \nthe signature \nof interest. The ultimate result is to \nreduce the I images comprising the hyperspectral \nimage cube into a single \nim- age where pixels \nwith high \nintensity indicate the presence \nof the desired signature. This represents a \nsignificant re- \nduction in data volume since 1 is >200 for current \nand planned airborne hyperspectral sensors. Since the classi- \nfication operator reduces each pixel \nto an unknown con- stant in white noise, the \nresultant image can \nbe sensibly thresholded and an automatic binary classification \ndeci- 78 1 sion can be \nmade based on the Neyman-Pearson detection criterion [12], [19]. This criterion \nmaximizes the proba- bility of detecting the \npresence of the signature of interest subject to \na user designated false \nalarm rate. The extension \nof this vector operator for a single sig- \nnature to \na matrix operator for \nk signatures of interest is \nstraightforward. The \nk X 1 matrix operator is given \nby Q=(ql*-*qi--* qdT (10) where each of the qr = d'P, is formed \nwith the appro- \npriate desired \nand undesired signature vectors. In this case, the \nhyperspectral image \ncube is \nreduced to k images which classify each \nof the signatures \nof interest. IV. SIMULATION RESULTS In this section, we present an \napplication of the orthog- \nonal subspace projection (OSP) technique to linearly \nmixed reflectance spectra. In the \nfirst case, 100 hyper- spectral pixels were simulated using \nthe red soil and dry \ngrass reflectance \nspectra shown in Fig. 1. These spectra \nwere first convolved to 10 nm spectral bands to \nsimulate the capability \nof current airborne hyperspectral sensors. The abundance \nof each material varied \nfrom pixel \nto pixel, and white Gaussian noise \nwas added to each pixel \nto achieve a 25 : 1 signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise \nratio is defined here \nas 50% reflectance divided \nby the standard deviation \nof the noise. This \nshould not be con- fused with the signal-to-noise-energy ratio which is max- \nimized in \n(6) to develop the \noptimal classification \nopera- tor. Pixels 20, 40, 60, and 80 also contain the creosote \nleaves reflectance \nspectrum, shown in Fig. 1, at \n20, 15, 10, and 5% abundance, respectively. \nTo illustrate the se- \nverity of the detection/classification problem, pixels 18-22 are shown in Fig. 2. Pixel 20, which contains the creosote leaves spectrum at 20% abundance, is not distin- guishable from \nthe neighboring pixels. The \nmissing por- \ntions of the spectra are \nwhere the 1.4 and 1.9 pm water \nbands have been removed. \nAn OSP classification operator was formed using \n(9) where d is the creosote leaves \nspectrum and the two col- umns of \nU are the red soil and dry grass spectra. \nThe result of applying the operator to \neach pixel \nis shown in Fig. 3. The pixels containing \nthe creosote leaves spec- \ntrum are evident. \nA second simulation \nwas run \nusing the reflectance spec- tra in \nFig. 4. Again, 100 mixed pixels were \nsimulated, and in this case, we form an operator to detect sage \nbrush in the presence of both creosote leaves \nand black brush. \nAs before, pixels 20, 40, 60, and 80 contain the \ntarget reflectance spectrum, sage brush, at 20, 15, 10, and 5% abundance, respectively. \nIn this case, white Gaussian \nnoise was added to each pixel to \nachieve a \n50: 1 signal- to-noise ratio referenced to 50% reflectance. The result of applying the operator \nto each pixel \nis shown in Fig. 5. This is clearly \na more difficult classification problem than \nthe first \nsimulation, but the presence \nof the sage brush \nspectrum is \ndetectable in all but the 5% abundance case. \n, "b"782 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 32, NO. 4, JULY 1994 2 0.5 6 0.4 0.3 0.2 :::[ 0.7 - - - - 0.8 0.7 -4 1 1 1.5 2 2.5 WAVELENGTH (MICRONS) Fig. 1.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS USING AVIRIS DATA The OSP technique was also applied to a subsection of an AVIRIS scene of the Lunar \nCrater Volcanic Field (LCVF) which is located in Northern \nNye County, NV. Extensive field \nwork has been done in this area, and the AVIRIS scene covering \nit has \nbeen previously \nmodeled using spectral mixture analysis [20], [2 13. A single band image from the \nAVIRIS data is shown in Fig. 6. Atmo- spheric water bands \nand low SNR bands have \nbeen re- \nmoved from the data, \nreducing the image cube from \n224 to 158 bands. The signatures used to develop the OSP classification operator are the same image endmembers \nthat were used to model the scene with spectral unmixing techniques in [20]. These endmembers, \nwhich are extracted directly \nfrom the \nimage, are the radiance spectra \nof red \noxidized basaltic cinders, rhyolite, playa, vegetation, and shade \n"b'HARSANYI AND CHANG: HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION \n& DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION \nFig. 6. AVIRIS image of \nthe Lunar Crater Volcanic Field (0.752 pm channel). (e) Fig. 7. OSP operator output: \nLCVF subsection. Operating on \na 200 X 200 pixel subsection \nfrom the upper left comer of the LCVF, scene (a) yields component images \nfor each of the chosen material image endmembers. \nThe component image \nin (b) indicates the \npresence of red oxidized basaltic \ncinders, (c) \nclearly shows the dry playa lakebed, \n(d) indicates exposures of \nrhyolite, (e) \nshows vegetation, and (f) represents shade which accounts \nfor variable lighting \nand topography. \nThe data reduction provided by the operator \nin this case is \nfrom a 158 band hyperspectral image cube \nto five component images which \nprovide information of interest regarding the \nchosen image endmembers. \nwhich accounts for \ntopographic shadowing \nand variable lighting geometries within \nthe scene. It \nis important to \nnote that \nit is not necessary to \ncalibrate the \nAVIRIS data to reflectance before \napplying the \northogonal subspace ap- \nproach. In this case, we develop an operator based on ra- diance spectra, and operate directly \non the measured ra- diance for each pixel \nin the scene. For this experiment, we develop the classification \nop- erator for \neach of the image endmembers \nas in (10). Ap- plying the \noverall operator to the \nimage results in a di- \nmensionality reduction \nin this case \nof 158 to 5. The resultant component images \nfor each of the endmembers are shown in Fig. 7. These component images represent \nclass maps of the various endmembers, and are consistent \nwith known \nattributes of the scene \nwhich have been de- \ntermined by field observations and mapping \n[20], [22]. \n'b'784 IEEE TRANSACTIONS \nON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. 32, NO. 4, JULY 1994 VI. CONCLUSION An approach for simultaneously reducing hyperspectral \ndata dimensionality and detecting hyperspectral signa- \ntures of interest in the presence \nof undesired or interfering signatures has been \ndeveloped and demonstrated. The \ntechnique can be viewed as a \ncombination of two linear operators into \na single \nclassification operator. The \nfirst operator is \nan optimal interference rejection process \nin the \nleast squares \nsense, and the second is an optimal detector \nin the maximum SNR sense. The approach is \napplicable to both mixed \npixels as well as spectrally \npure pixels, and does not suffer from the limitations \nof standard statistical classifiers and matched filtering/spectral signature \nmatch- ing techniques which are suboptimal in the presence \nof multiple correlated \ninterferers. Application of the technique \nto simulated hyperspectral \nmixed pixels shows that \nrepresentative signatures \nof in- terest can be \ndetected at \nabundance levels as \nlow as a \nfew percent at \nsignal-to-noise ratios ( 5 50 : 1) and spectral resolution (10 nm) which \nare easily attainable with exist- ing airborne hyperspectral \nsensors. Performance will, of course, vary depending on the particular scenario, \nbut this technique can be \nused as an analysis tool to examine the \nsensor capabilities required to solve a particular detection \nand classification problem. The technique has also \nbeen applied \nto data \ncollected with the Airborne \nVisible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) from \nthe Lunar Crater \nVolcanic Field \n(LCVF) in Nevada. The technique \nproduces component images \nwhich represent class maps of the various materials \nof in- terest within the scene. Component images generated \nfor the LCVF scene are \nreasonable when compared to pub- \nlished geologic \nmaps of the area \n[23] and corroborating field observations [20].
