b'CAR PLATE RECOGNITION BY NEURAL NETWORKS\nAND IMAGE PROCESSING\nR.Parisi, E.D.Di Claudio, G.Lucarelli and G.Orlandi\nINFO-COM Dpt.\nUniversity of Rome La Sapienza\n Via Eudossiana 18I-00184 Rome, Italy\nemail parisi@infocom.ing.uniroma1.it\nABSTRACT\nIn this paper we describe an experimental system for the\nrecognition of Italian-style car license plates. Images are\n\nusually taken from a camera at a toll gate and\n\npreprocessed by a fast and robust 1-D DFT scheme to\n\nfind the plate and character positions. Characters are\n\nclassified by a multilayer neural network trained by the\n\nrecently developed BRLS learning algorithm. The same\n\nneural network replaces both the traditional feature\n\nextractor and the classifier. The percentage of correctly\n\nrecognized characters reaches the best scores obtained in\n\nliterature, being highly insensitive to the environment\n\nvariability, while the architecture appears best suited for\n\nparallel implementation on programmable DSP\n\nprocessors.\n1. INTRODUCTIONCar license recognition is important in several fields of\napplication:\n traffic control in restricted areas;\n automatic payment of  tolls on highways or\nbridges;\n general security systems wherever there is the\nneed of identifying vehicles.\nSome approaches exist and have been described in\nliterature. They are mainly based on pattern matching and\n\nnormalized correlation with a large database of stored\n\ntemplates.\nIn this paper we describe an experimental system for the\nrecognition of Italian-style car license plates. The system\n\nis based on the use of a feedforward neural network\n\n(FNN) trained with the Block Recursive LS algorithm\n\n(BRLS), described in [1] . This learning approach has\n\nbeen shown to guarantee high rates of convergence and\n\nproperties of stability and robustness of the solution. The\n\ndata at hand consist of digitized images of cars, acquired\nby a high-resolution 35 mm photo camera and collected\nin a Photo CD. The processed images (see Fig.1) are 390\n\nby 480 pixel wide. The distance and the angle of view\n\nsimulate a car passing through a toll gate.\nThe recognition process starts with the search and the\nextraction of the portion of the original image containing\n\nthe car plate. The characters contained in the plate are\n\nlocalized by a robust processing using a non-traditional\n\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and subsequently\n\nisolated and classified by the neural network. The scores\n\nare validated by a post-processor which takes into\n\naccount the syntax of Italian-style plates.\nThe neural network is trained off-line with a set of error-\nfree synthetic characters, while competing approaches\n\nneed a large database of real-world images. The fast\n\ntraining convergence and the surface error model adopted\n\nin the BRLS approach allow to find reliably a local\n\nminimum in the mean squared error (MSE) cost function\n\nwith a high grade of generalization capability.\nWith respect to a recently published work [2] our\napproach is able to reduce the complexity of the learning\n\nphase (no feature extraction and pattern matching are\n\nrequired). The character recognition has been speeded up\n\nby the parallel architecture of the FNN. The algorithm\n\nhas been tested on a workstation featuring a Pentium Pro\n\nPC 200 MHz processor and the Matlab software. The\n\nnext step will be to write hand-optimized routines in a\n\nhigh-level language such as C++ or also assembler to\n\nenhance the processing speed.\n2. OUTLINE OF THE ALGORITHM\nThe whole algorithm consists of the following sequential\nsteps, each using a different and application-oriented\n\napproach.\nStep1: Image preprocessing\n. The digitized image (Fig. 1)\nis preprocessed by tone equalization and contrast\n\nreduction. This technique has been preferred to other\n0-7803-4455-3/98/$10.00 (c) 1998 IEEE'b'alternatives, such as edge enhancement, for the better\nrobustness and suitability for the next processing stage.\nStep2: Plate location detection and extraction.\n Empirical\nevidence suggests that dimensions of the car and the plate\n\nin the image acquired by a typical toll gate camera should\n\nnot vary more than about 15%. This fact enables for a\n\nfast localization technique which avoids an expensive\n\nnumerical search over large areas. The character spacing\n\nproduces neat spatial harmonics in the horizonal\n\ndirection, that can be detected by spectrum analysis.\nIn the presented system the horizontal stripe of the image\ncontaining the plate is found by maximizing the global\n\nenergy of expected harmonics. The harmonic\n\ndecomposition is accomplished by a row-wise DFT,\n\nfollowed by a synchronized average  [5] in the spatial\n\nfrequency domain, as shown in Fig. 2. This kind of\n\nprocessing uses the global energy estimated from\n\nharmonically related frequency bins as the detection\n\nstatistic. For example, a single average will involve the\n\nperiodogram estimates { P(k), k=1, 2, N/2 } [4]\n\nobtained from the DFT { X(k), k=1, 2, N } at bins 2, 4,\n\n6, etc  In practice, a relatively robust estimator Q(p) of\n\nthe harmonic standard deviation is employed [6] :\n<==2NK1kabs(X(kp))K1Q(p),(1)\nwhere the function abs(z) indicates the modulus of the\ncomplex argument. This particular estimator has been\n\nchosen also for the simplicity of implementation in most\n\nDSP processors and VLSI dedicated chips.\nThe vertical location of the plate is found roughly in the\nsame way, by using a small column-wise DFT on the\n\ncandidate(s) stripe(s) found in the previous step (Figs. 3,\n\nand 4).\nStep 3: Character localization and segmentation\n. After\nthe plate has been located, the relative image portion is\n\nquantized to binary values according to an adaptive\n\nthreshold established directly through a two-class\n\nclustering of tones. The characters are segmented by\n\nfinding white areas between columns with higher density\n\nof black pixels (Figs. 5 and 6).\nIsolated black pixels are wiped out and the character is\nresized to the standard measure of (10 by 6) pixels after a\n\nfactor-of-two decimation (Fig. 7).\nStep 4: Recognition by the FNN\n. The FNN has been\ntrained with the English character set by the BRLS\n\nalgorithm [1] . For each character, several replicas\n\nshifted by one pixel in each direction have been\n\npresented to the FNN, in order to enhance the\n\ngeneralization capability [3] . The fast convergence of\nthe algorithm, combined with the low misadjustment\nnoise with respect to the classical backpropagation, has\n\ndriven the working point of the network toward a well-\n\nbehaved minimum. In fact, the BRLS algorithm is able to\n\nfind an extremum surrounded by a nearly quadratic\n\nhypersurface, which is typical of a near Maximum\n\nLikelihood [4] (e.g. good) estimator of neuron weights.\nThe FNN used in this system was two-layered with 60\ninput, 30 hidden and 35 output neurons, that act as a\n\ndemultiplexer of the 35 possible characters that can be\n\nfound in Italian plates.\nStep 5: Plate validation\n. The plate number is\nreconstructed from the recognized characters. Gross\n\nerrors are limited by a comparison with a database of\n\nrules, describing the acceptable sequences of characters,\n\naccording to the Italian legal plate numbering scheme.\nThe overall recognition rate of the system has been  the\n90%  on a validation set of fifty real-world images, with\n\n8% of rejection rate and one (2%) false recognition. The\n\npercentage of correctly recognized characters has\n\nreached the 98.7%. Most rejections happened with old\n\nand dusty plates, almost unreadable also by human eyes.\n\nThis performance compares directly with the data\n\nreported in [2] .\n3. DISCUSSION\nThe presented application is an example of the capability\nof neural networks to perform complex signal processing\n\nand classification tasks with real-world data.\nThe car-plate recognition is a relatively complex task, for\nthe variety of environment and targets, and the ordinary\n\npresence of disturbing elements (dust, non-standard\n\npositioning of plates, rain, fog, etc...). In traditional\n\nsystems, there exist separate procedures for image\n\npreprocessing, plate alignment, filtering, template\n\ncorrelation and winner selection. These algorithms are\n\nideally sequenced, and rely on the robustness of previous\n\nstages to furnish a valid answer.\nAlgorithm sequencing may generate an unrecoverable\nloss of information at each step, further reducing the\n\nchance of arriving to a correct final decision.\nIn the proposed experimental system, a single FNN\nreplaces several algorithm blocks required by traditional\n\nprocessing with a parallel architecture realizable with\n\nDSP VLSI circuits, having the capability of a very high\n\nspeed of recognition at low costs.\nIt is worth to point out that a state-of-the art classification\ncapability performance has been achieved with a training\n\nset formed exclusively by artificially-generated examples.\n0-7803-4455-3/98/$10.00 (c) 1998 IEEE'b'The BRLS algorithm once more demonstrated its\nintrinsic resistance to the presence of ill-shaped regions\n\nof the error surface (non-convex, nearly flat) and of local\n\nminima that do not meet the basic requirements for being\n\nlocally good estimators of neuron parameters. The fast\n\n(superlinear) convergence speed of the BRLS was not a\n\nprerequisite for the particular application, since the\n\ntraining can be done off-line. Anyway, the BRLS\n\nlearning reduced greatly the setup times for experiments\n\nand is suitable for on-line adaptive training, when needed\n\nto compensate for miss-modelling.\nThe search for typical spatial harmonics generated by the\nnearly regular character spacing on the plate is also a\n\ndistinctive feature of the proposed procedure, remarkable\n\nfor the overall robustness and near optimality of the\n\ndetection. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) could\n\nbe considered as a substitute for the DFT, with possible\n\nreduction in computational costs, due to the real\n\narithmetic involved.\nThis simple recognition system demonstrates that most\nexisting approaches are excessively complicated both\n\nfrom the theoretical and algorithmical points of view. In\n\nfact a judicious choice  made on statistics and distinct\n\nmodelling features of the data at hand can be coupled\n\nwith well known general-purpose tools (transforms,\n\nrough statistical estimators, neural networks,\n\noptimization algorithms) to generate an information-\n\npreserving processing with state-of-the-art performance.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThe presented application is an example of the capability\nof neural networks to perform complex signal processing\n\nand classification tasks with real-world data with an\n\nunified architecture. Neural networks can replace a\n\nsequence of classical procedures with a single\n\narchitecture, well suited to parallel custom\n\nimplementations.\nThe joint optimization of neural parameters w.r.t. the\nerror functional minimize the risk of a loss of\n\ninformation.\nA good generalization capability of the learning\nalgorithm is required to provide a good practical\n\nperformance, especially when artificial training data is\n\nused, like in the proposed scheme.\nThe BRLS learning algorithm once more demonstrated\nits intrinsic robustness to the presence of ill-shaped\n\nregions of the error surface and was able to find quickly\n\nphysically meaningful solutions to the given optimization\n\nproblem.\nAnother distinctive element of novelty of the proposed\nrecognition system is the character location strategy,\n\nwhich requires only 1-D DFT or DCT processing,\n\ntogether  with a robust averaging of harmonic spectral\n\npeaks.\n5.
